### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm jashanpreet kaur, a fervent software development student at MITT. Armed with a keyboard and a cup of coffee, I embark on the exhilarating journey of transforming lines of code into meaningful solutions. My coding adventures began with the classic "Hello, World!" and have since evolved into a fascination with programming languages.

In the vast universe of technology, I'm currently immersed in the intricacies of coding, pushing my boundaries to grasp its nuances. I'm also passionate about contributing to open-source projects and fostering a collaborative coding culture.
